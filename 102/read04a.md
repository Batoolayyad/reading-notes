Js make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content while it is viewed in the browser
SHOWSLIDED
Slideshows can display a number of different images
(or other HTML content) within the same space
on a given page. They can play automatically as
a sequence, or users can click through the slides
manually. They allow more content to be displayed
within a limited amount of space
FORMS 
Validating forms (checking whether they have been filled in correctly) is important when information is supplied by users. JavaScript lets you alert the user if mistakes have been made. It can also perform sophisticated calculations based on any data entered and reveal the results to the user.

RELOAD PART OF PAGE 
You might not want to force visitors to reload the content of an entire web page, particularly if you only need to refresh a small portion of a page. Just reloading a section of the page can make a site feel like it is faster to load and more like an application. React: Script triggered when user clicks on link
FILTERING DATA
If you have a lot of information to display on a page,
you can help users find information they need by
providing filters. Here, buttons are generated using
data in the attributes of the HTML <img> elements.
When the user clicks on one of the buttons, they are
only shown the images with that keyword.
the JavaScript language can be used to tell browsers what you want them to do.

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES
1-	The name must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($),or an underscore (_). It must not start with a number.
2-	The name can contain letters, numbers, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_). Note that you must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name.
3-	You cannot use keywords or reserved words. Keywords are special words that tell the interpreter to do something. For example, var is a keyword used to declare a variable. Reserved words are ones that may be used in a future version of JavaScript.
4-	All variables are case sensitive, so score and Score would be different variable names, but it is bad practice to create two variables that have the same name using different cases
5-	Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores. For example, fi rstName might be used to store a person's first name, l astNarne for their last name, and age for their age.
6-	If your variable name is made up of more than one word, use a capital letter for the first letter of every word after the first word. For example, f i rstName rather than fi rstnarne (this is referred to as camel case). You can also use an underscore between each word (you cannot use a dash).
array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in a numbered list. It is important to know that the numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).
