# Introducing my self
# *BATOOL AYYAD*

Hello!
my name is **Batool**,
I'm a fresh graduated electrical engineer. I'm totally new to programming but I'm choosing it as a career for the flexibility that it has. 
And like almost every one my favorite thing to do is: 
- traveling.
-  meeting people.

I was scared at the beginning to change for the programming path because its like ~learning chines~ for me but as a person that enjoy the challenges it gives me the motivation to do needed the effort to become good at it.
