**mailto:**  we use it to open the user email  program and add the address that we want in it, we use it in the same way with &lt;a&gt; tag but we start the email in href with mailto.


**(target)** to open the link in different page, target= ‘ _ blank’.

# Chapter 3: Functions 

## What we need to know about functions?


**why we need functions?**


Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

**How we write a function?**

We can write functions in two ways, look at the figure below:

**How and when we call the function**

We call the function by it name and we do it out of the function when we need to use it.
So function need to enter a values and we do it by calling the name of the function, functName(value1, value2, ..);
