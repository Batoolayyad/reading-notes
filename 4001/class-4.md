### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development


1- Better program design and higher code quality
2- Detailed project documentation
3- TDD reduces the time required for project development


### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
 a way to do an action before after your tests finish. It’s commonly used for doing a cleanup after your test is finish. also when writing your test in GUI mode, after a test is finished, you can keep interacting with your page.


### What is one downside of Test Driven Development
[geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-test-driven-development-tdd/)

- the slow process
- Tests got to be maintained when requirements change –
- All the members of a team got to do it –

### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

Instances are typically instantiated via constructor functions with the new keyword. Class inheritance may or may not use the class keyword from ES6. Classes as you may know them from languages like Java don’t technically exist in JavaScript. Constructor functions are used, instead. The ES6 class keyword desugars to a constructor function:
class Foo {}
typeof Foo // 'function'



### Why REST?
[mulesoft](https://www.mulesoft.com/resources/api/restful-api)


can be used over nearly any protocol, when used for web APIs it typically takes advantage of HTTP. This means that developers have no need to install additional software or libraries when creating a REST API.
REST APIs is that they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia. 


#### class:
[developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/class)
The class expression is one way to define a class in ECMAScript 2015. Similar to function expressions, class expressions can be named or unnamed. If named, the name of the class is local to the class body only.


#### this
[developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/class)
 keyword behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to other languages. It also has some differences between strict mode and non-strict mode.


#### super
[developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/class)
The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.


#### object-oriented programming (OOP)
[www.educative.io](https://www.educative.io/blog/object-oriented-programming)
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm used by nearly every developer at some point in their career. OOP is the most popular programming paradigm and is taught as the standard way to code for most of a programmers educational career.


#### Continuous Integration (CI)
[cloudbees](https://www.cloudbees.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration)
is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.


#### Test Driven Development (TDD)
[guru99](https://www.guru99.com/test-driven-development.html)
 is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.


 #### Jest
 [jestjs](https://jestjs.io/)
is a delightful JavaScript Testing Framework 


#### Data Model 
abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.


#### SQL VS NOSQL
[thegeekstuff](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
the type of data to be stored: SQL databases are not best fit for hierarchical data storage. But, NoSQL database fits better for that typs of dat, also NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

#### Mongodb as an example of NoSQL Database

- **Mongodb** is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema.
