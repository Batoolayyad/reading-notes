### What is Amazon API Gateway?
[AWS API Gateway Overview](https://www.serverless.com/amazon-api-gateway)
Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic.


[AWS API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. 

### Benefits of Amazon API Gateway?
[AWS API Gateway Overview](https://www.serverless.com/amazon-api-gateway)

- Map HTTP requests to specific functions in a Serverless application viaanAPI Gateway event
- Map WebSocket events to Serverless functions.
- Use multiple microservices to serve the same top-level API. 
- Save time with integrations: authentication, developer portal, CloudTrail, CloudWatch.


### How does API Gateway work?
[AWS API Gateway Overview](https://www.serverless.com/amazon-api-gateway)

API Gateway sits between the backend services of your API and your API’s users, handling the HTTP requests to your API endpoints and routing them to the correct backends. It provides a set of tools that help you manage your API definitions and the mappings between endpoints and their respective backend services. It can also generate API references from your definitions and make them available to your users as API documentation.
