# How to Solve Programming Problems

### Common mistakes


one of the most common mistakes when it comes to solve programming problems is to start coding right away, this first make sure you are on the right path then start the coding it will save you a lot of time.

## A simple set of steps can use for any algorithm type programming problem:


1-**read the problem twice**: most importent step is to understand the problem and you can tell whether or not you can explain the problem to someone else.


2-**Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data**: It is very important to solve the problem manually first, so that you know what you are going to automate.


3-**Optimize the manual steps**: what you do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify


4-**Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code**:what you do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.


5-**Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code**:All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.


6-**Optimize the real code**: figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.

* If you start thinking in that way you will stop wasting your time on pointless things and become more protactive.

* If you are busy it just mean you are not focused, distracted and its also some how  form of mental laziness which is mean you’ve been lazy and undisciplined, and have let too many unimportant tasks take you away from what really matters. you need to have clear vision on your goals do not tolerating distractions.

* Steve Jobs: “People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.”

Demonstrating computational thinking or the ability to break down large, complex problems is just as valuable (if not more so) than the baseline technical skills required for a job.” — Hacker Rank (2018 Developer Skills Report).

Solving problems is the most important skill that employers look for and what are best way to start solving problem is to have:


- framework.


- practicing it.


## the steps to solve poblems:


1- Understanding the problem and you can tell it you understanding the problem if you are able to explain it in plain English.



2- having plan, start with clear steps. to have a good plan: 


- answer this question:“Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”


- Sidenote: using the Comments!


3- Divid the big problem into a small sub problems and start solving them one by one, begin with the simplest (the one you know the anwser for). after you are done connect them to reach the solution for the big problem.


4- what to do when getting stuck:


- Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong(Debug).
- Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
- Google it: someone has probably solved the problem you'er having

**Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time**


5- practicing

## when to use it?


most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems.



## How to use it?


1- Assemble a Team: Gather people who are familiar withthe problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix.


2- Define the Problem: observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on. For example.


3- Ask the first why: Search for answers that are grounded in fact: they must be accounts of things that have actually happened, not guesses at what might have happened.


4- Ask "Why?" Four More Times: For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.


5- Know When to Stop: You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking "why" produces no more useful responses.


6- Address the Root Cause(s): After identify at least one root cause, you need to discuss and agree on the counter-measures that will prevent the problem from recurring.


7- Monitor Your Measures: Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem. You may need to amend them, or replace them entirely. If this happens, it's a good idea to repeat the 5 Whys process to ensure that you've identified the correct root cause.
